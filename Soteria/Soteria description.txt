The Greek Goddess Soteria was known as the Goddess of safety and preservation from harm.

Known for being related with other Gods of protection, Zeus, Persephone, etc..., she was seen as a protector of cities, and was worshiped very highly.

The Soteria project came about when I visited Pax River Naval Aviation Museum, and saw on display numerous radar systems that were used in aircraft. I did some more digging and realized that common microcontrollers and sensors could make a "radar" of sorts. The idea of radars has always been fascinating to me, and I have always wanted to know more about them.

During this time, I was starting to learn about micro controllers in my free time, and started looking up projects to do with one. I stumbled upon projects that use sensors and a servo that constantly rotate and is able to provide a return on an object within between 1-13 feet, when met with the right criteria.

My goals for this project are:
	have a servo (side to side or 360) continuously loop while an ultra sonic sensor sends out waves that would then hopefully give a return signal.
	I then want to have a screen where it mimicks a radar scanner, that would then return the location of the object.

As of now (11-10-24), I am currently outlining my code, learning how my hardware works, etc...
