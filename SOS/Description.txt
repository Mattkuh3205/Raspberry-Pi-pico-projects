I developed this project as a way to expand off of the "Hello world" of micro controllers, blinking an LED.

Having little to no experience with micro controllers, and only just learning how to blink an LED, I looked up ways on how to expand the concept, and found a simple, yet more applied challenge.

The goal of this project is to utilize the Onboard LED and the "sleep" function from pythons library, and combined those to blink morse code, specifically, I wanted it to blink SOS.

SOS in Morse code is 3 short signals, 3 long, 3 short, and it loops back. I took advantage of while loops and wrote out the structure of the blinking in segments.
